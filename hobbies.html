                <h2>Travel</h2>
                <p1>
                    I enjoyed traveling during my time away from class and work. I usually try to go on vacation once to twice a year during
                    school breaks and over the summer. This photo was taken in Japan in January of 2024 right before winter break ended. It was
                    a trip my partner and I had been planning for more than a year and we finally made it happen!

                <h2>Cross Stitch</h2>
                <p1>
                    I began cross stitching over the COVID-19 period. My partner originally picked it up as their hobby and I was facinated
                    by everything they were creating. This is the pattern and project I am most proud of. It took almost a year to finish 
                    and was the first larger stitch I did!

                <h2>Dungeons & Dragons</h2>
                <p1>
                    I have been playing Dungeons & Dragons on and off for 6 years now. I had a group of friends who really enjoyed playing it
                    and they convinced me to join them for a session. My partner played as well and encouraged me to get into it. I joined my
                    friends for a view sessions and was very confused and I almost didn't continue. I joined a group that my partner had started
                    with some of her friends from school/work. I had understood the game more and had alot more fun! 
                    I usually play every Saturday afternoon!
